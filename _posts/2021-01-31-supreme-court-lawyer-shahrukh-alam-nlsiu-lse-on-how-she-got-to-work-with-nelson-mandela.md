How does one become a lawyer at the Supreme Court and get to work for Nelson Mandela's advisor after scoring in the 60s in the 12th boards? Well, it's not tough if you work hard later. Shahrukh Alam, our guest in the 12th episode epitomizes that. She holds an LLB degree from NLSIU and LLM from the London School of Economics. Shahrukh comes across as someone who has done everything in life. She has worked as a social activist, policy-maker, field researcher, professor and now practices as a lawyer in the Supreme Court of India.
