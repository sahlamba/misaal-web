A boy started living away from his parents since he was 5 years old in a good education quest. From not having a good school in his village to cracking the formidable UPSC examination with an AIR 115, Quaiser Khalid’s story qualifies for a big banner Bollywood project.

 In this interview, we bring you the struggles of someone who moved into a cosmopolitan environment from a village setting. While most of us feel intimidated by people who are better than us or are doing extraordinarily well in their field, Quaiser Khalid’s formula was to identify the aspects that make these people better and learn those skills.
