Millions of people like to play volleyball. Fewer want to play in high school. Even fewer hope to play in college. Even fewer imagine themselves playing in the Olympics.

And then there's [Kerri Walsh Jennings](https://twitter.com/kerrileewalsh), who not only dreamed of playing in the Olympics... but who won actually won a bronze medal and three gold medals.

Clearly Kerri thinks big -- which is why it's no surprise that her latest venture is of a similarly grand scale. [p1440](https://www.p1440.com/) ("p" stands for platform, "1440" for the number of minutes in every day) is an [event series and digital community](https://www.p1440.com/faq.php) designed to elevate the sport of beach volleyball and provide inspiration and resources to live life more fully.

Where the events are concerned, think Coachella, Wanderlust, and professional volleyball all rolled into one: Music festival, health and wellness village, yoga and Pilates lessons... the goal for Kerri and her husband Casey is to provide something for everyone -- or at least, as Kerri said when we spoke, "for everyone who wants to live a life of intention."

Which, of course, *is* everyone.

**Clearly you're capable of achieving at an extremely high level, but still: This is a really big venture.**

(Laughs.) You're right. It *is* a lot. But what we're doing is needed not just in our sport but in the world at large.

Start with the sport of beach volleyball. Our goal is to give back to a sport that is sick at the top level but healthy everywhere else. The sport is too great for it to stay status quo, so we're thinking big.
