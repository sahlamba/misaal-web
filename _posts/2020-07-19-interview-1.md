The government has done all it can to ensure that people from northeastern states don’t face any race-related problems in metropolitan cities, minister of state for home affairs Kiren Rijiju has told ThePrint.

Rijiju said the government has implemented all recommendations of the M.P. Bezbaruah committee, which was formed to find solutions following the 2014 murder of Nido Tania, a student from Arunachal Pradesh, in Delhi.

The murder had led to large-scale protests by students from northeastern states and activists, who alleged that this was the latest example of racist crimes against people from the region in big cities such as New Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru.

“Most recommendations have been implemented, but certain long-term recommendations, like including a syllabus under UGC, will take time,” Rijiju said, referring to the University Grants Commission, which decides higher education curricula for institutes across the country.
