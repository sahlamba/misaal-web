Firdaus Haque, who hails from a small village in Jehanabad in Bihar, is a graduate of IIM Ahmedabad and BIT Sindri. He did not have the requisite mentors and the positive examples around him while growing up, so at a very young age, he has picked up the habit of seeking help and finding mentors. From studying at a school without a roof and under the kerosene lamp, he has gone on to become the Business Lead at the Mahindra Group and was a founding member of its electric mobility team. Currently, he is an Upstream Officer at International Finance Corporation, an entity under the World Bank group and his curiosity has led him to pursue LLM from NLU Bangalore.
