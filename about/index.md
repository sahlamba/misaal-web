**Vision**

India where everyone has equal opportunities to unleash their full potential and contribute to nation’s development.

**Mission**

<!--StartFragment-->

Misaal’s mission is to inspire and support young Muslims to dream, to break through the glass ceiling, and to build a life of socio-economic comfort. 

As per the All India Survey on Higher Education 2018-19, Muslims comprise 5.23% of the total number of students enrolled in colleges. This is abysmally low as compared to their 14.2 % share in population (Census 2011). According to the Sachar Committee Report, only 1 out of 25 students in undergraduate courses and 1 in 50 students in postgraduate courses in premier institutes is a Muslim. It is an alarming situation for the community as well as for the nation when a sizable chunk of the young population is not educated.

In order to make a positive difference, we dream of an ecosystem standing on three pillars:

* Inspiration, through stories of high achieving Indian Muslims
* Support, through mentorship programs and scholarships
* Up-Skilling, through workshops
